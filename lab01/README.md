#CS262 - Lab 1

This lab is based on expo tutorial at https://expo.io/learn

Hacks that I had to make:
none

Answers to the lab questions:
* app
* Multiline for TextInput is a prop and name is a state element
* The curly braces represent that the code inside of them is javascript
* The function that occurs onChangeText is an anonymous function
* The app does not use CSS or html as neither IOS or Andriod support it, React tries to emulate CSS to a certain extent because it is familiar.
