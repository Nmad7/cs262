# CS 262 - Lab 11

I used the Prettier extension for VSCode with ESLint for code suggestions. I reviewed the following suggestions in cusstomize.js in the team project client.


## Accepted
- Switched all doublequotes to single quotes unless escaping
- Deleted unused variables
- Added a space after // in comments
- Switched any let assignments to const if they are not reassigned
- Indentation alterations 


## Rejected
- ESLint by default wants unneccessary semicolons removed, google javascript style says they should be kept
- Some formatting changes made to JSX made parts harder to read in my opinion
