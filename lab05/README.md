# CS262 - Lab 5

This lab is based on NetNinja's 
[Todo application](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9ixPU-QkScoRBVxtPPzVjrQ) 
(lessons 24-26)

Hacks that I had to make:
I had to change headerLeft to headerTitle in order to center the title as in the video. The cs262 webpage still says for this lab that the custom fonts and the details screen were removed, but I think those were for the last lab and should be updated.
